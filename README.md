Welcome to My Profile Website. This is an extension of my resume and contains my work experience. For now the entire website exists here on github, but it will eventually move to it's own website. For now the way to view this is by using node. 

* First clone the repository 
* Use "git install" 
* Use "git run dev" 
* The server should then be running on localhost:3000
